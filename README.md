I have followed the tutorial on Medium about a smart contract named ViperToken.


I have taken the code of an existing smart contract named ViperToken. 

I have deployed a project in truffle with his code. 

After compiling and seeing there is no issue with the solidity code. 

I have been on Remix where I compile again. 

And deployed the contract with Metamask.
